                    <p>Last year, I went to see a handful of movies with my friends, most on Tuesday when the price
                        dropped at Cineplex for their Big Deal Tuesdays. We saw the following movies
                        last year: Mickey 17, A Minecraft Movie, Sinners, Weapons, Superman, Fantastic
                        Four: First Steps, Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc, Zootopia 2, Five Nights at Freddy's, and
                        The SpongeBob Movie: Search for Squarepants. I wanted to analyze a few of the movies, their
                        ratings, and their box office performance.</p>

                    <p>I saw this movie in theatres three times. I think that says enough. I first saw it with my parents and my cousin who was visiting from Japan. Then, I went to see it with another friend who apprently didn't have anyone to watch it with. I finally watched it for a third time in theatres with my best friend Silvana (we also watched Weapons in the same day, right before Superman).</p>

                <p>I LOVED this movie and I'd watch it over and over again if I had the time. Every aspect of it was beautifully executed -- I could really go on about it. It sparked a lot of political discussion across its audience, completely unintentionally. But it only further proved to be one of, if not the best adaptations of Superman. James Gunn and David Corenswet had a perfect understanding of the Superman Character.</p>

                    <p>I went to Mickey17 with a friend from work almost a month after its release. We were the only two
                        people in the entire theatre. It was quite fun! The movie itself was definitely interesting, it
                        kept me thinking and on the edge of my seat. I enjoyed the character development between Mickey
                        17 and 18, and I wouldn't mind watching it again.</p>

I went into Zootopia 2 with little to no expectations, I didn't know much about it, but felt a little on edge with ANOTHER Disney sequel. However, I found that I loved this movie too. It was heartwarming, and actually almost pulled some tears from me. They did a wonderful job tackling some issues that are relevant to today's society.</p>

                <p>Before watching the movie, I heard a lot of good things about it, so I'm not surprised it did so well. However, I am surprised it ranked 2nd out of every movie in 2025 last year, when it only came out about a month before the year ended. I think party of why it did so well is because the audience for this movie has such a wide age range, but it's not to discredit its success. I think it was a great movie.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Overall, I think 2025 was a great year for movies. It had a wide variety of genres and styles, and many of the top movies were critically acclaimed and financially successful.Watching movies in theatres actually wasn't really something I did often until last year, and because of all the movies I watched last year, it's become a hobby for me and my friends. If we see a movie that's interesting, we'll try to find time to watch it (specifically on Tuesdays!) Next on my list is Iron Lung... by Markiplier!</p>
